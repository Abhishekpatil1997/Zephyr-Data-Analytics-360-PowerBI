# **Zephyr-Data-Analytics-360-PowerBI**
## **Project Overview:**
At Zephyr Hardware, a global electronics leader, we're transitioning to a data-driven approach with Power BI and SQL to tackle operational challenges. Over-reliance on Excel caused setbacks in certain regions, prompting a data analytics initiative by senior management. Leveraging last year's data, our goal is to enhance performance.
## Data and Modelling
We used a MySQL database to load the data and connected it with Power BI. Data modelling was done in Power BI using the Power Query editor and DAX measures we built as per requirements. Visualizations were then built for the following views:
## **Finance View:**

## **Sales View:**

## **Marketing View:**

## **Supply-Chain View:**


The visualizations provide insights into the performance, trends and opportunities across these key business functions.
